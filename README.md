GitHub Action for checking out a repository. (Simplified [actions/checkout] alternative that does not depend on Node.js.)

## Usage

This action currently provides a minimal subset of the features provided by [actions/checkout].

The features supported as of v1.0.0 are purely based on my use cases within public repositories, but feel free to submit an issue if you see something missing in your use case. See [issues](https://github.com/taiki-e/checkout-action/issues) for known unsupported features.

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/checkout-action@v1
```

Almost equivalent to (for public repositories):

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    persist-credentials: false
```

## Why not actions/checkout?

As of 2024-03-08, the latest version of [actions/checkout] that uses node20 [doesn't work on CentOS 7](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2906).

Also, in `actions/*` actions, each update of the Node.js used increments the major version (it is the correct behavior for compatibility although), so workflows that use it require maintenance on a regular basis. (Unless you have fully automated dependency updates.)

## Compatibility

This action has been tested for GitHub-hosted runners (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) and containers (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Alma, openSUSE, Arch, Alpine, OpenWrt).

On Linux, if any required tools are missing, this action will attempt to install them from distro's package manager, so no pre-setup is usually required (except for CentOS or Debian 10 (or older) or very old distro described below, which was already EoL and needs to use vault/archive repos -- see "Install requirements" in [our CI config](https://github.com/taiki-e/checkout-action/blob/HEAD/.github/workflows/ci.yml) for example of setup).

On other platforms, at least the following tools are required:

- bash 3.2+
- git 1.8+

Known environments affected by the above version requirements are CentOS 6 (EoL on 2020-11) and Ubuntu 12.04 (EoL on 2017-04) using git 1.7 (see "Install requirements" in [our CI config](https://github.com/taiki-e/checkout-action/blob/HEAD/.github/workflows/ci.yml) for example of workaround).
